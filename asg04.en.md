# Assignment 4: Web Application

Students will build their own web application
using the approaches learned in class.

## Objectives

To build a web application based on the learnings in the course.
You will use your GitHub repository (e.g. `emergency_waitlist`)
to build this web application using the core
skills learned in this course including:

* HTML/CSS for front end design
* JavaScript for client side interactions
* PHP (or similar) for server side interactions
* Postgres (or similar) for managing data

## Sample Application

If you have your own application, please update
the the names below (e.g. `emergency_waitlist`) to
align with your application.

If you do not have your own web application idea,
then you can build a hospital triage application
as described below.

The Hospital Triage applicaiton helps staff and patients
better understand wait times while
in the emergency room.  The application will be administered
by the triage staff based on two dimensions: severity of injuries
and the length of time already in the queue.  Administratorâ€™s will
see the full list of patients, but users can sign-in with their
name and 3-letter code showing an approximate wait time, which is
updated as patients are treated.

## Deliverables

You will submit all code in your GitHub code repository (e.g. `emergency_waitlist`).

You will provide a `README.md` to describe
your application both from a developers perspective (how to setup/run
it locally). And, from the user perspective (how to use the application).
The user documentation should include details from both the
`admin's` and `patient's` perspective.

If you create your own application, then a similar level of complexity is required
where you as an administrator can manage data separately from your users
accessing (and to some extent also inputting) that data.

You will add a technical (and visual) outline in your portfolio projects
section.
